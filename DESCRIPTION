Description: scNPF is a R package for pre-processing of sing
		le-cell RNA-seq data by leveraging the context-specific
		topology inherent in the given data and the network 
		information from priori gene-gene interaction networks.
		scNPF consists of two modules, including scNPF-propagation
	  for imputing dropouts based on random walk with restart (RWR) 
	  and scNPF-fucion for fusing multiple smoothed expression 
	  matrices to a cell-cell similarity matrix. scNPF is highly 
	  integrative and flexible in that the two modules are 
	  independent but interconnected. scNPF can be used as a 
	  general and flexible pre-processing step prior to 
	  downstream analyses of scRNA-seq data for recovering 
	  gene expression lost, correcting gene expression 
	  measurements, and learning similarities between cells.
